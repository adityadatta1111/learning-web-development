<!-- Non-void element: Includes both an opening and a closing tag -->
<!-- Void element: includes only the closing tag -->
<!-- It's better to use space before the "/" of a void-element/self-closing tag, as in, <br /> is better than <br/> -->
<!-- <p> is better than <br /> for new lines with different context, but <br /> is better with the context of a same paragraph <p> -->
<!-- <hr> and <hr /> are same but <hr /> is preferable by convention -->
